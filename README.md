# FizzBuzz
## What is this project?
### Framework:
This project starts with a variable, i, set to 1, and increments it up to 100. For each value of i, the program checks whether the number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. 

### Logic and Output:
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it outputs "FizzBuzz". If the number is only divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz", and if it is only divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz". 

### Default Output:
If the number is divisible by neither, it simply prints the number itself. This pattern continues from 1 to 100, replacing numbers with words based on their divisibility by 3 and 5.
